        <img src="../challenge2/assets/AboutMe.jpg" class="aboutmeimg">
        <p><strong>Howdy, I'm Ballard Ingram!</strong> If you guessed it correctly, I'm in Texas. I've spent the last decade garnering years of experience in Management, Operations, People Leadership, and Process Training. I have experience in several industries (e.g. Telecommunications, Hospitality, Insurance, Social Media, Banking, Healthcare, and Utility) making me well-rounded subject matter expert. <br><br>
        Recently, I've joined "The Great Resignation," and realign my career goals. You see, working in corporations, big and small, I've seen some things that go beyond scratching your head. At the time, I took my limited skills and resources and built systems that improved efficiencies and reduced exposures. I'm only weeks into my journey with coding and I'm very surprised to see how what I was doing was a lot of wireframing, but nothing sustainable. With the skills I'll be mastering, I can take those early visions and turn them into a working reality. Maybe, even a company of my own. <br><br>
        I could not have done this without a great support system behind me. I'm very fortunate to have a supporting husband and three (3) absolutely fantastic sons. They are monsters, but I love them. As I go through my journey with coding and take on additional projects I'll write them a letter. I'll miss movie nights, I'll have to rush dinners, and I'll trade out funny cat videos for Coding Youtube tutorials. It's going to be worth it in the end... <i>because it will just be the beginning.</i></italics></p>

        <p>I'm just starting out, but hey, something is better than nothing. Over time, I will be adding additional work products here. Come back later to see what I've done.</p>

        <p><strong>Tulip!</strong><br> This project is in progress and not related to the assignments I'll be completing during this course. It's the work product of everything combined. It's what I'm hoping my company will be once I'm done with this course. It's not going to be a site, but software that allows oranizations to create their own:</p>
