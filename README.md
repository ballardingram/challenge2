# Professional Profile

## Purpose
This website was built to showcase my advanced CSS skills and build a professional profile. It will be submitted as a part of Challenge 2 for my UT Full Stack Bootcamp.

## Built With
This website was built with HTML and CSS. I used VS Code to write and edit the code. I used Chrome's Dev Tools to make small changes that I could preview prior to making changese to the actual code. The logos, colors, and designed were created in Power Point after wireframing the entire look of the page.

## Website
You can find the final product at:

## Contributions
This was largely and independent project. I worked with my TA Ian Sears to get support with the box model issues I had.

## Observations
During the initial wireframing process I found myself struggling to draw out what the page would look like. The final product is more literal instead of a vision of what I really wanted. I anticipate I will be making changes to this overtime to add separate pages and JAVA Script.

## Challenges
I'm going to call out the fact that I added "<br>" to the body of the page because I couldn't get the spacing correct between projects. I'm sure it is something simple, but I did not want to obsess over it and not finish.

## Screenshots
Below are screenshots and a gif of the page:
